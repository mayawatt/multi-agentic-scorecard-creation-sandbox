This is part of a co-project with Franklin Fuchs https://github.com/fuchsfranklin. We are evaluating three methods for generating scorecards in the context of R&D development in 
pharmacuiticals. These three methods are LLM, LLM plus RAG and standard methods for scorecard generation. The repository is currently private, but this sandbox includes smaller
sub-experiments, mainly with the goal of testing the robustness of LLM-generated code for querying JSON files.
